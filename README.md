🔰 Beginner-Level Sensor Interfacing with STM32 using STM32CubeIDE

This project is a beginner-level implementation focused on learning how to interface multiple sensors using an STM32 microcontroller with the help of STM32CubeIDE. The aim was to gain hands-on experience in embedded systems development and sensor data handling.

🧪 Sensors Used

LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) – to read ambient light levels via ADC.

Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04) – to measure distance and detect obstacles.

DHT20 (Temperature & Humidity Sensor) – communicates via I2C.

IMU (MPU6050) – to measure acceleration and rotation (I2C-based).
